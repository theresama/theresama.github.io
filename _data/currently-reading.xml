  <description>The wildly popular online comic Coffee with Jesus, described by Library Journal as offering "disarmingly funny reflections on human failings and faith," is back with a venti-sized second volume. Find yourself in your favorite characters, and laugh with Jesus at the absurdities of our world and the ways we walk in it. Follow your favorite characters as they honestly engage with Jesus about their successes and failures and wants and needs, effectively showing what conversation with God or prayer might look like. These poignant and pointed visual vignettes are rife with good theology and will have you laughing for days."</description>

  <description>The agents at the IRS Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Illinois, appear ordinary enough to newly arrived trainee David Foster Wallace. But as he immerses himself in a routine so tedious and repetitive that new employees receive boredom-survival training, he learns of the extraordinary variety of personalities drawn to this strange calling. And he has arrived at a moment when forces within the IRS are plotting to eliminate even what little humanity and dignity the work still has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Pale King&lt;/i&gt; remained unfinished at the time of David Foster Wallace's death, but it is a deeply compelling and satisfying novel, hilarious and fearless and as original as anything Wallace ever undertook. It grapples directly with ultimate questions--questions of life's meaning and of the value of work and society--through characters imagined with the interior force and generosity that were Wallace's unique gifts. Along the way it suggests a new idea of heroism and commands infinite respect for one of the most daring writers of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A New Translation, with an Introduction, by Gregory Hays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, Marcus Aurelius’s &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt; remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. Marcus’s insights and advice—on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others—have made the &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt; required reading for statesmen and philosophers alike, while generations of ordinary readers have responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gregory Hays’s new translation—the first in a generation—Marcus’s thoughts speak with a new immediacy: never before have they been so directly and powerfully presented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marcus Aurelius Antoninus&lt;/b&gt; (A.D. 121–180) succeeded his adoptive father as emperor of Rome in A.D. 161. A student of philosophy from his earliest youth, he was especially influenced by the first-century Stoic thinker Epictetus. His later reputation rests on his &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt;, written during his later years and never meant for formal publication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gregory Hays&lt;/b&gt; is assistant professor of classics at the University of Virginia. He is currently completing a translation and critical study of the mythographer Fulgentius.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Inspired by the true story of a political murder that horrified Russians in 1869, Fyodor Dostoevsky conceived of Demons as a "novel-pamphlet" in which he would say everything about the plague of materialist ideology that he saw infecting his native land. What emerged was a prophetic and ferociously funny masterpiece of ideology and murder in pre-revolutionary Russia.&lt;br /&gt;~penguinrandomhouse.com</description>

  <description>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole--a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considered &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In &lt;em&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts&lt;/em&gt;, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syntax&lt;br /&gt;Objects&lt;br /&gt;Functions&lt;br /&gt;Inheritance&lt;br /&gt;Arrays&lt;br /&gt;Regular expressions&lt;br /&gt;Methods&lt;br /&gt;Style&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful features&lt;br /&gt;The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to &lt;em&gt;unlearn&lt;/em&gt; all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;em&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts&lt;/em&gt;, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.</description>

  <description>For Christians, Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, who died for the sins of the world, and who rose from the dead in triumph over sin and death. For non-Christians, he is almost anything else-a myth, a political revolutionary, a prophet whose teaching was misunderstood or distorted by his followers. Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and no myth, revolutionary, or misunderstood prophet, insists Benedict XVI. He thinks that the best of historical scholarship, while it can't "prove" Jesus is the Son of God, certainly doesn't disprove it. Indeed, Benedict maintains that the evidence, fairly considered, brings us face-to-face with the challenge of Jesus-a real man who taught and acted in ways that were tantamount to claims of divine authority, claims not easily dismissed as lunacy or deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benedict XVI presents this challenge in his new book, Jesus of Nazareth: From His Transfiguration Through His Death and Resurrection, the sequel volume to Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was Jesus rejected by the religious leaders of his day? Who was responsible for his death? Did he establish a Church to carry on his work? How did Jesus view his suffering and death? How should we? And, most importantly, did Jesus really rise from the dead and what does his resurrection mean? The story of Jesus raises these and other crucial questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benedict brings to his study the vast learning of a brilliant scholar, the passionate searching of a great mind, and the deep compassion of a pastor's heart. In the end, he dares readers to grapple with the meaning of Jesus' life, teaching, death, and resurrection. Jesus of Nazareth: From His Transfiguration Through His Death and Resurrection challenges both believers and unbelievers to decide who Jesus of Nazareth is and what he means for them.</description>
