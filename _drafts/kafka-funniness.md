> It's not that students don't "get" Kafka's humour but that we've taught them to see humour as something you *get* - the same way we've taught them that a self is something you just *have*. No wonder they cannot appreciate the really central Kafka joke: that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle. That our endless and impossible journey towards home is in fact our home. <span class="source">- David Foster Wallace</span>  


well, shit.
