title: Another Year, Another Blog
---

Here we go, it's another September, another school year; we're all so fresh from summer, equipped with eager expectations for how much we'll learn and accomplish this year. Midterms are still a six-week stress away, and ah, admit it, we almost missed the feeling of a lecture hall. Or at least I did.

Four months of summer passed by so quickly. I spent it working full time in downtown Toronto at StackAdapt, a native advertising startup, as a Front End Web Developer & Technical Integrations Specialist (that means I custom created native ad units for publishers & overhauled the company's website + client dashboard). Work's a totally different thing from school; it was a new experience & I loved it (shout out to the StackAdapt team for being awesome to work with & putting up with my bananas). Turns out that you really do get better at something if you do it 8 hours a day for awhile. No way, eh? 

Starting my third year of university, this is when I really start to delve into computer science. Course load for the year:

	Fall: 
	CSC373H1 - Algorithm Design & Analysis 
	CSC343H1 - Intro to Databases 
	CSC324H1 - Programming Languages
	CSC318H1 - Design of Interactive Computational Media
	PSY473H1 - Cognitive Neuroscience

	Spring:
	CSC384H1 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence
	CSC309H1 - Programming on the Web 
	CSC369H1 - Operating Systems 
	CSC358H1 - Intro to Computer Networks 
	PHL341H1 - Freedom, Responsibility, & Human Action 

I spent most of today switching my site from a Rails App on Heroku to setting up a GitHub User Page & Jekyll, so I'm hoping this all turns out well. Blogging effort is like a new year's resolution, but I'll try to write up little blog posts to track the progress of the semester & we'll see how this goes!
