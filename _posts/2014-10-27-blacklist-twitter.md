This is a Chrome extension that removes tweets from your timeline that contain blacklisted content (a list of things you don't want to see). Because the Internet lets you customize your experience the way the real world doesn't. 

Honestly, I made this little thing because Taylor Swift released her new album on my 20th birthday. This being the Internet, and me being me, I didn't want to deal with seeing her all over my Twitter timeline. I'm sorry it was such a first world problem, but it was fun being able to write a short script to rid a minor annoyance.

It currently works with a txt file of things you want to block; primitive but effective. You can get it <a href="http://theresa-ma.com/Blacklist-Twitter" target="_parent">here on Github.</a>
