title: Canadian Immigration & Citizenship Case Study Redesign

This was a term long project for CSC318: Design of Interactive Computational Media, based on the design problem presented in the CHI 2015 Student Design Competition: "Appropriating Technologies for New Cultures". 

Completed in collaboration with four other group members, this extensive project focused on a user-centered redesign of the Canadian Immigration & Citizenship visa application website. 

From our conducted questionnaires and interviews, it was discovered that users, primarily foreigners, experienced a great deal of difficulty when navigating the Canadian Citizenship and Immigration website. The site is text-heavy and verbose which makes it difficult for ESL users to navigate the site in order to find relevant information for their situations. We proposed a solution for these issues by re-organizing the way that content is presented on the site. Currently, content is presented in a list-style textual manner, and close reading of the whole page is necessary in order to navigate through the site. In organizing the content in such a way that the user can sift through information that is only relevant to their personal needs, the site will be more friendly for ESL users unaccustomed to reading large chunks of English text.
