title: facts & feelings on U of T's TA strike
category: blog
---

CUPE3902 Unit 1, representing over 6000 TAs and course instructors, has been on strike at the University of Toronto since February 27th. I’ve been trying to keep up with the developments and reading opinions from both those in support of and again the strike (aka reading the arguments on Facebook, Twitter, & Reddit). Between people not wanting to read long blocks of text, and the inefficacy of arguments presented over back and forth single liners, there’s been a whole lot of frustration, confusion, misinformation, outrage, and general upset with the situation. What follows are the facts I've gathered in reading those arguments, and my feelings as an affected and informed undergraduate student. 

##facts
This strike is mainly about the minimum graduate funding package, so the discussion of the TA hourly rate is irrelevant and possibly damaging; graduate students are under contract to TA for a certain number of hours per year and what they earn as a TA is included in the funding package. The minimum funding package was set at \$15,000 in 2008, and it has been frozen there, while the cost of living in Toronto continues to increase. At the rate of inflation, the minimum funding package as of 2015 should be almost \$17,000. This is still below the low income cutoff line. 

(An objection I’ve read to this is that CUPE3902 is not a graduate student union and should have no bargaining rights over the graduate funding package, but I’ve also read that it was CUPE3902 that resulted in a minimum funding package in the first place, so there is precedence for this)

Graduate students are expected to do full time research for the university. 
Some of them are even contractually obligated not to pursue any other form of income while employed by the university. 
Grad students who attend no classes still pay full tuition for some reason? Part of the bargaining includes seeking a tuition break. 
Graduate funding is a standard expectation; U of T should at least offer funding to the same level as other top tier universities.

The old contract expired and this is the bargaining process for a new contract; it isn’t the situation that graduate students are suddenly unsatisfied with their funding.

Tuition fees for undergraduates will not increase as a result of this; the university already increases tuition by the maximum 3% each year. The university is also operating on a $200 million surplus.

Yes, these links are biased towards CUPE3902, but there is plenty of opposition on the page, and the university has given very little useful information on the strike - which leads me to the feelings...

##feelings

As a 3rd year domestic undergrad, I am at a much lower loss / potential loss than international students and those planning to graduate in May. They are the ones with the most to lose, and tensions are running high. Everyone just wants the strike to end so we can resume regular programming (pun intended).

I think the best way to end the strike is to support CUPE3902. I was on the fence until I read the disingenuous email that the university sent out.

(you sneaaaaky provost!)

Yes, I realize that much of everything is built upon clever PR strategies that prey upon our desires and weaknesses, and much of all we see is what people want us to see - but I guess I expected, or wanted, my institution of higher learning to be different. 

I’m not saying that CUPE3902 isn’t doing anything wrong, but when they’re the ones open and waiting for negotiation while the University refuses to even get back to the table, it definitely seems that CUPE3902 is approaching this with more sincerity than none, and supporting them is the option for a quicker end to the strike.

As much as I want to believe that I’m a ~free thinking individual~ who forms her own opinions, it really matters to me the opinions of those I look up to. If my profs, some of whom are the most gifted and caring educators I’ve ever had, are supporting the strike, then there is probably a good reason. If [hundreds of faculty in 28 departments at this university are supporting the strike](http://www.weareuoft.ca/endorsements-and-letters-of-support/), it definitely gives it plausibility (and perhaps makes this administration seem more ridiculous).

Now, do they have to block the roads, and cause such disturbances? Are they being selfish in not considering the educational needs of the undergrad? Why are they using us as bargaining chips? Is it the TAs who are disrupting our education, or is it the university’s fault for not fulfilling its responsibility to ensure that these disruptions don’t occur, or are minimized? 

Then again, is this the kind of disruption that's necessary? I’d like to believe that no one would want to cause such disruptions unless necessary (this may be too optimistic). Don't we have some responsibility to care for others' causes? Isn't their cause for a livable wage reasonable and justified? To what cost of our own comfort and convenience will we tolerate? 

This also raises the question - what's up with our universities and how they're run? What are the ideals of what the university as an institution ought to be, and what is it actually? How did we get here? Why is the university taking its current stance on negotiations with CUPE3902? Where did the rum go?
