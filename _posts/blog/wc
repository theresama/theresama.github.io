Backpacker's Guide To Quarterly Planning 

Your mileage may vary.

A couple of summers ago, I took a backpacking trip through Europe for 12 weeks. I didn’t just suddenly land in Europe. I’m not the ~spin the globe and point~ kind of person, but nor am I the ~plan every day~ type of person. There’s a sweet spot in the middle that works well for me.

A year out, I knew I wanted to backpack through Europe - just a vague sense of adventure. If you showed me a map of Europe, I probably couldn’t name most of the countries. 

Europe’s huge! Where do you start?
Your team’s to-do has hundreds of items - where do you start?

Six months out, I saw a great deal on a flight and booked a one way ticket to London. 

Then, I started planning.

You know when your quarter starts - you know when you need to know.

Maybe your quarter planning doesn’t happen as far out, but you probably have some sort of long term roadmap in mind, not too unlike the Pinterest board of all the places I'm going to visit one day and notes of various half planned trips ranging from weekend getaways to multi-month adventures. 

First step - pull out a map. There's a reason the analogy is "roadmap". Literally, a road map. 

I wanted to go to Europe and I had a flight to London. Great. Then what for 12 weeks? Where are all the places I should go? Which cities should I hit up? 

Thank you maps.google.com. 

Take into consideration - are there non-negotiable deadlines? Are there certain places you have to be at a certain time? 

I wanted to see Coldplay in London on June 15th and Radiohead in Switzerland on July 2nd. I had to be in Krakow by July 18th and then head to Prague with a friend on August 1st. Those were my priorities and deadlines and all other plans had to flow around those. 

Does your team have strict deadlines on particular projects? Is there a meeting with an investor on a particular day, by which you need a MVP? Is there something you need to coordinate with another team on? Are there external factors you need to take into consideration for your upcoming quarter? These are the priorities all other projects in the quarter will need to be planned around.


Ideally, go in only one direction. No doubling back. 

Plan ahead but leave room for spontaneity. 
Reducing cost & risk while being open to adventure & spontaneity. 

Planning ahead reduces your costs drastically, whether it be transportation, lodging, or time. 

Planning on the trip takes time from the trip. But when you have 12 weeks, you're have to do some planning as you go. 

You have time. Do things one at a time. 

Same with planning for a company. 

Larger picture planning
Which places how long which path?
Do some scoping - prices, travel routes, average number of days people need there
Pick the places from the possibilities
Non-negotiable deadlines - place you have to be at a time 
Be realistic about pace 
Travel days are mostly not sightseeing days
Commit. Book your tickets. 

People want to do different things. 
Alice wants to spend an extra few hours in the museum while Bob wants to do some souvenir shopping and gelato eating? Sure. Scope in some free time. 

Know your travel style. You'll know your team's working styles with time. 

One of the most common travel planning mistakes is rushing. 
You want to see as much as you can in the limited amount of time, so you try to pack everything in. This leaves everyone exhausted and burnt out at the end. 

Rookie mistake: oh, it's only a three hour train ride from London to Paris - let's plan to take a morning train from London and we'll get to Paris in the afternoon and count that as 1 day in Paris. 

No. You have to take into consideration the time it takes to pack up your things in London, check out, make your way to the train station, arrive at the train station early, then once you arrive in Paris, find directions and make your way to where you're staying, check in, and unpack. All of that is exhausting and it takes time. I don't count travel days as part of the number of days in a city. The time in a city right before departure and right after arrival are a few bonus hours which you can use to catch your breath or squeeze in one last trip to your favourite crepe place. 

The same with quarterly planning. Team members will go on PTO, there are events, meetings, coffees, endless interruptions, all of which chisel away at those nicely blocked weeks of time. The "developer day" you're scoping needs to take all those into consideration. 

Finer grained scoping - which attractions are in which city? Where are the best local eats? Which attractions make sense to be grouped together? How many paintings can you reasonably be interested in seeing in a day?

Shit still happens. Unplanned-for shit. Lose your passport? Get food poisoning? It's fine. We can adapt. The better you know your plan, the better you know which parts you can bend.
