<p>Walking through the streets near Brussel’s Grand Place inhaling the wafting scent of waffles - you know you gotta get one. Or two. Or three. Or learn to make a lifetime supply for yourself. I signed up for an afternoon of all-you-can-eat learn to do-it-yourself Belgian waffle tutorial from the <a href="http://www.waffleworkshop.com/">Waffle Workshop</a>. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1820" data-orig-height="1820" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/71fae1b80554f3d8c30042c07c8e433e/tumblr_inline_o9amlc2DLM1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1820" data-orig-height="1820"/></figure><p>I told this to my boyfriend who laughed and asked if I was going to sign up for a grilled cheese or pb&amp;j workshop too: “it’s just making batter &amp; putting it on a waffle iron”. <i>Duh</i>, but surely there’s something special about a <i>Belgian</i> waffle.</p><p>First thing I learned: there’s no such thing as a “Belgian waffle” - that’s a marketing trick. There’s the ‘<i>liege’</i> street waffle, and the “<i>Brussels waffle</i>”. The street waffle is a dense waffle made with sugar - it’s very sweet, a bit chewy, and traditionally eaten plain as a snack.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="4032" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/a8bde4af8e5d94be2525fbd0b315a235/tumblr_inline_o98q7c6rPv1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="4032"/></figure><p>The Brussels waffle is a light unsweetened waffle that’s crisp on the outside and still soft (almost gooey) on the inside. This is the waffle for topping up with jams, honeys, spreads, fruit, powdered sugar, etc. You can get them on the streets for only 1 euro.</p><figure data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="534" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/f5958a836d32031039d121bd2384216c/tumblr_inline_o98qpiEv5u1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="534"/></figure><p>(Brussels waffle from <a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/maison-dandoy-bruxelles">Maison Dandoy</a>)</p><p>Second thing I learned: waffles aren’t a breakfast food. It takes at least three hours for the yeast to do its thing. Too hangry for that. Waffles are an especially indulgent afternoon treat. Making waffle batter for six servings? 1.5 cups of oil. Yep, that’s <i>cups</i>.</p><p>Anyway, here’s the Waffle Workshop recipe:</p><blockquote><p>Mix in a bowl:</p><ul><li>500g (18oz) of self-rising flour<br/></li><li>3 eggs<br/></li><li>1 pinch of salt<br/></li><li>2 packs of vanilla sugar (0.56oz)<br/></li><li>1 spoon of cassonade (Belgian brown sugar)<br/></li><li>1⁄2 pack of baking powder<br/></li><li>35cl of corn oil (1.5 cup)<br/></li><li>35cl of milk (1.5 cup)<br/></li><li>28cl of sparkling water or beer (1.25 cup)<br/></li></ul><p>Stir the mix very well until you get a homogeneous batter with small air bubbles and no lumps. When your waffle iron is hot, insert a small quantity of batter in the machine, close it and flip it after 3 seconds. The waffles should cook between 3.5 and 5 minutes depending on your iron. After extracting the waffles, separate them, decorate them and eat them all! Bon appétit.</p></blockquote><p>The most important parts are mixing the batter enough, having a hot enough waffle iron, and knowing when your waffles are perfectly ready.</p><p>Third thing I learned: Pay attention to your waffle! I got too excited about waffle decorating &amp; forgot about my waffle which ended up burnt. Whoops. Other people shared their non-burnt waffles and all was delicious. No sad waffles here.</p><figure data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="2267" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/d5ff729e4e9ef9cfb547f8812f7e2371/tumblr_inline_o9ami642dW1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="2267"/></figure>
