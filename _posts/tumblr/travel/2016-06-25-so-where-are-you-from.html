<p>That’s the go-to opening line if I’m sitting with someone who’s also aimlessly scrolling through their phone. It’s an easy way to get to know other backpackers around the breakfast table; everyone’s travelling from somewhere and has stories to share: where they’re from, where they call ‘<i>home</i>’, where their family’s from, where they were born, where they live now, where they’re travelling, where they’ve been, where they want to go&hellip; location is the foundation for every life narrative. So much of <i>who I am</i> is tied to <i>where I’m from</i>. </p><p>More on this later. I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately.</p>
