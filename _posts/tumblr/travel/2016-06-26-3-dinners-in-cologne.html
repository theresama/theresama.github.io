<h2>First night: Schnitzel </h2><p>First night in Germany - gotta order the schnitzel, whatever that is. I really didn’t know what schnitzel was when I ordered it; I thought it would be a sausage. When it arrived and looked nothing like a sausage, I thought it was a piece of thin deep fried dough. After I cut a piece, I finally realized that schnitzel is a thin piece of meat that’s been battered  &amp; deep fried.</p><figure data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="2264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/31eef4d180d321e8ad6eb794779b84d7/tumblr_inline_o9efctwIwF1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="2264"/></figure><p>It was pretty good, but didn’t blow my mind. </p><p>When asked what I wanted to drink with my meal, I made the mistake of asking for tap water. The server had a weird look for a moment but gave me the glass of tap water. When looking up German tipping etiquette, I found out that asking for tap water is a faux pas. Order the bottled still water. Whoops.</p><h2>Second night: Himmel un Ääd</h2><p>Learning from the first night, I ordered a beer. They come in cute little 200mL glasses! Now that’s my kind of beer. </p><p>“Himmel un Ääd” is a traditional dish in Cologne: black pudding, mashed potatoes, onion, &amp; applesauce. </p><figure data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="1084" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/6da5b985760e17c383cb1868fa540542/tumblr_inline_o9ef3yJFZ01rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="1084"/></figure><p>Anything with mashed potatoes is good by me, but it was the black pudding that was the highlight. I admit to have been a bit hesitant about it at first (black pudding is blood sausage), but forgot about any qualms after the first bite.</p><p>It came wrapped in crispy filo - a contrast to its smooth creaminess. The consistency was a bit creamier than the mashed potatoes, and they went together like two best friends. </p><p>Heh, I actually thought the applesauce was a mushroom sauce at first - I’d only ever seen dessert applesauce. The slight tartness of the sauce offset the fatty flavour of the pudding &amp; potatoes. </p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.yelp.de/biz/reissdorf-am-hahnentor-k%C3%B6ln">Reissdorf am Hahnentor</a> for delicious local Cologne eats. 4 stars on Yelp with all German reviews - you know it’s legit :p.<br/></p><h2>Third night: German pork knuckle</h2><p>I went back to Reissdorf am Hahnentor for dinner again, since the black pudding was so good. I was recommended the pork knuckle and was convinced.</p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/51eb72cff8eb240f4be637331be472ed/tumblr_inline_o9ef3eT5f71rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure><p>IT’S HUGE. It could feed two people for dinner. The skin was crispy and sticky (I’d never had pork <i>stick</i> to my teeth) while the meat on the inside was so tender.</p><hr><p>I’ve really been lacking the fruit &amp; veggies lately. I’ll pick up a bag of apples or something to make up for it ;). </p>
