<p>I’m about three and a half weeks in. I’m tired. I’m physically tired from the long days of walking. On average, I’ve been walking over 10km a day. </p><p>I’m also itching to sit down &amp; make something (websites).</p><p>One of the differences with longer term travelling is being able to - and needing to - make time for down time. Not everyday needs to be filled with adventure &amp; activity. I&rsquo;m still enjoying the feeling of finding my way through unfamiliar streets, stumbling upon surprising history, and experiencing the serendipity of meeting happy strangers. It is tiring though, and it’s okay to take it slow. </p><p>I caught a cold on my way to Amsterdam, and then it rained that whole day. Instead of pushing myself to go out and go hard in the cold rain, I curled up on the hostel couch and had a warm soup, tea &amp; honey, Kleenex, &amp; Kindle day. It felt so good to just relax and <i>be</i>. My body definitely needed it too, and I had the speediest recovery, feeling fresh after only three days. <br/></p><p>Doing something ordinary and mundane like the laundry or just catching up on an episode of Silicon Valley becomes refreshing. I guess that’s why I’m writing some things down here and trying to take time to reflect.</p>
