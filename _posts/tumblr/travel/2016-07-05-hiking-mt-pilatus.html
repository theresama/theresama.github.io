<h2>Thurs. July 30 - Day 3 in Switzerland</h2><p>Hiking the whole way from Alpnachstad  is labelled as “medium” difficulty for a duration of 4 - 4.5 hours up 5500ft of elevation, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to walk the next day if I did that. There’s one stop on the way at Amisgen at 4459ft which is quite a bit easier of a starting point.<br/></p><p>Even knowing that I could hike the shorter distance, the steep elevation intimidated me and I almost wanted to just ride the rail all the way up. The forecast called for thunderstorms &amp; I hadn’t packed hiking boots. I went up anyway, thanks to the nice ticket lady who convinced me saying it was easy enough.</p><h2>The Numbers</h2><p><b>Duration:</b> 1.5 - 2 hours from Amisgen</p><p><b>Elevation:</b> 640m/2100ft</p><p><b>Distance:</b> 3.1km/1.92mi. I couldn’t find any posted information on the trail distance so I tracked it on my way using RunKeeper.</p><p><b>Bring:</b> 1L of water &amp; a snack. I did it in sneakers, but I’d recommend hiking boots.</p><h2>The Journey</h2><p>It started with the world’s steepest cogwheel rail (max gradient at 48%) from Alpnachstad up Amisgen at 4459ft. This was the scary part; I feel much better having the ground beneath my feet. </p><figure data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="4032" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/d7b972b76d8ddac76faa1b2e32998983/tumblr_inline_o9us4p28Xy1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="4032"/></figure><p>The driver dropped me off at Amisgen and from there upwards, I was on my own. Except for the cows. The sound of the cowbells followed me most of the way. </p><p>I’d read up a bit on the trail beforehand and expected cows along the way, but I thought they’d be in pastures or farms on the side. Nope - they are literally on the trail. I watched a cow poop in front of me - this is another reason for hiking boots.</p><figure data-orig-width="750" data-orig-height="689" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/185148e87d78ea6cad60f928a4550579/tumblr_inline_o9usgpiVd31rh3e2c_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="750" data-orig-height="689"/></figure><p>Don’t forget to close the gate. Past the cows comes the rocks, and then the clearings in the valley. </p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/44eab91815c7ab97d2dfd20aaffb5fa2/tumblr_inline_o9ussfbZvJ1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/697613bb6c7915805ae227895bfd50fd/tumblr_inline_o9ustimGLO1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure><p>About an hour from the top, I could see the hotel atop Pilatus. That was the toughest part of the hike. The grassy &amp; rocky path turned to small stones that slipped beneath my feet. I could hear the tourists at the top. </p><p>It was super cloudy by the time I reached them - couldn’t see anything but white. A warm soup &amp; coffee later - it’d cleared up enough to see the closest mountains, but nothing past that. On a clear day, you should be able to see everything until the horizon. </p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/99524f50d58b178182fba7c2fcce3d49/tumblr_inline_o9utn2YtoX1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure><p>Even on a cloudy day, it was worth the hike. I’d do it again just for the cows. </p><figure data-orig-width="960" data-orig-height="720" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/5909c26473e1176d575dcdfb56ad7f3e/tumblr_inline_o9uszkRdYl1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-height="720"/></figure>
