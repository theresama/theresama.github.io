<h2>Friday July 1st - Day 4 in Switzerland</h2><p>Serendipitously in Zürich during Züri Fäscht - Switzerland&rsquo;s largest festival happening every 3 years with 2 million visitors. I stopped in Zurich for a day trip on my way from Lucerne to St. Gallen and saw people selling programmes for Züri Fäscht. I looked it up and found out that it&rsquo;s a huge deal with fireworks on Friday &amp; Saturday night and the whole city partying along the lake until sunrise.</p><p>I had to check into my hotel in St. Gallen before 10pm but I couldn’t miss this festival. I looked up last minute hostels &amp; AirBnb options in Zurich, but no luck. I bought a round trip train ticket, went to St. Gallen to check in, put on my best dress, and made it back to Zurich in time to find a good spot for the fireworks. </p><figure data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="960" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/70ceead4ed9c5861bc704377402430af/tumblr_inline_o9uye6ZTfS1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="960"/></figure><p>Extra bonus: seeing fireworks on Canada Day while being in Switzerland.</p><p>The streets along the lake were filled with food vendors, stages, performers, fairground rides, and Caipirinha stands. Wow, the city was alive.</p><figure data-orig-width="960" data-orig-height="720" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/b8f560a218aedc74f07bf9b240dcf5d4/tumblr_inline_o9uyfpLiiN1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-height="720"/></figure><p>I walked along the lake, enjoying the atmosphere and treating myself to some late night cheese &amp; bread.  I’d never seen cheese like that - spherical and melting over fire. It was good &amp; went with my mini bottle of a Côtes du Rhône. </p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/39d35bfb308ead5da7a60bbd09cb76ac/tumblr_inline_o9uzqyxKRf1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure><p>I’m not a party-hard kind of person. By 12am, I was looking up directions for catching a train to St. Gallen. As I was about to leave, a guy came over and introduced himself and then said it was actually his friend who really wanted to say hi. His friend then sheepishly introduced himself and apologized for the first guy’s drunkenness. No worries. He introduced me to their whole group of ~10 friends and then I set off with them to another party spot where we all just talked &amp; had fun. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width="960" data-orig-height="720" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/2bdfc87a88ba35622cc1e7fe79cc8b4f/tumblr_inline_o9uyeupCaA1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-height="720"/></figure><p>They were mostly European students doing their Masters degrees in Zurich. One of them had backpacked across Canada for 3.5 months on a snowboarding tour. She’d seen more of Canada than me. Another one is moving to Berkeley next year for an exchange. Small tech world, I guess. </p><p>Since the festival only happens every 3 years, it was their first time at it too. They were ready for whatever the night brought them. I unfortunately had to catch the last 1:30am train to St. Gallen. Missing that would’ve committed me to a train the next morning. I had a taste of the night though, and that was enough. Maybe three or six years from now I’ll be back. </p>
