<h2>Switzerland Days 5-7: Openair St. Gallen</h2><p>This festival is the reason Switzerland was on my itinerary for this summer. I had to see Radiohead &amp; this was the viable tour date. Seeing Radiohead was on my bucket list, right below &ldquo;learn to make sushi&rdquo; and above &ldquo;publish a book&rdquo;. They were also the last band on my concert bucket list. They were worth waiting for.</p><p>It rained almost the entire day, turning the ground into thick mud. I had on a t-shirt &amp; a wind breaker. I bought a sweatshirt to keep warm &amp; was still shivering as I stood in the crowd. 

No one really seemed to mind the conditions though. Almost everyone had a yellow raincoat &amp; rubber boots. They were prepared. It rains a lot in Switzerland, one of them said to me. Festival attendees were mostly young groups of friends in their 20s, camping together &amp; day drinking, enjoying the music on the side.

After wandering around the festival grounds all day &amp; scoping out the crowd dispersion after each set, I staked out a spot right in the front center, behind the girl at the barrier, at 8pm. 45 minutes of waiting, 75 minutes of Caribou - a Canadian electronic group - 45 more minutes of waiting - and finally, Radiohead. </p><p>Yeah, they were perfect. Thom Yorke &amp; I made eye contact. Ed O’Brien &amp; I exchanged grins. Thom Yorke dancing warms my soul. How does Jonny Greenwood still look like he’s 17? </p><p>They finished off their second encore set with Karma Police: <i>“For a minute there, I lost myself. I lost myself”.</i> sang the crowd. <i>For a minute there, I lost myself. I lost myself. <i>For a minute there, I lost myself. I lost myself…</i></i></p><figure data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="405" data-orig-src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/17cc6f2a39d0c4694a3d11d29be04ea8/tumblr_inline_o9v2daQTMy1rh3e2c_540.jpg" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/17cc6f2a39d0c4694a3d11d29be04ea8/tumblr_inline_o9v41gkgGP1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="405" data-orig-src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/17cc6f2a39d0c4694a3d11d29be04ea8/tumblr_inline_o9v2daQTMy1rh3e2c_540.jpg"/></figure><p>It took me back to that first year of university. To sitting in the Hart House Arbour Room watching my jazz band conductor’s Radiohead cover band. I’d never listened to Radiohead. I didn’t know what the words were; the vocals just sounded like wailing. But it was hauntingly beautiful. I sat there listening &amp; crying.</p> 

<p>The next day, I went to the faculty of music library, took out all the Radiohead CDs, and ripped them into iTunes. Their music expressed my feelings better than I ever could. It still does. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="204" data-orig-width="1178"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/e16dbe4ce72543bf9d3541f0bd73e1a1/tumblr_inline_o9yku52dsv1rh3e2c_540.png" data-orig-height="204" data-orig-width="1178"/></figure><hr><p>Second day for Mumford &amp; Sons was tough. I was really starting to get nauseous from the smell of mud, and my whole body ached from the previous nights. This was my third time seeing them. They’re always phenomenal - full of feeling. But I wasn’t in the mood. I stood near the back. Then as soon as the first few guitar strums of Babel started, the exhaustion left and I danced my heart out. I still don’t know where that energy came from. </p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/22cf7152af994eaa8bd70993cefb062f/tumblr_inline_o9wr30tWQN1rh3e2c_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure>
