<p>Every time a relationship changes - suddenly all the things attributed to that relationship and person take on a new perspective. The larger a part that person played in your life, the larger a portion that person changes. All the big and little things and activities that once seemed so casual become inundated with new emotional implications as a result of the many connections we made between them and the person with whom we made them. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how many of these little connections we make. There are very few songs I can listen to without being reminded of someone, and even simple activities such as walking down a street or drinking chocolate milk become associated with particular individuals or certain memories. Then all of a sudden, when that person&rsquo;s gone, everything seems so much lonelier - the sense of aloneness augmented by the comparison of doing the same activity with and without that person. Does that make any sense? </p>
<p>Even when we meet new people and attempt to overwrite the past - it&rsquo;s only a substitution at best. It almost seems like the more relationships we go through, and the more we experience, the more difficult it becomes to find something new that hasn&rsquo;t been soiled by nostalgia. Even though the same activity with someone else would be <em>different</em> - not better or worse - there&rsquo;ll always be that shadow of the past. </p>
<p>Or perhaps I&rsquo;m just overly sentimental.</p>
