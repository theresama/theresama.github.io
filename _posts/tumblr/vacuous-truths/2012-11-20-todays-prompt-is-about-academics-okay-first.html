<p>today&rsquo;s prompt is about academics:</p>
<ul><li>okay first off, U of T supposed to be difficult for failing or doing well.</li>
<li>or at least that&rsquo;s what everyone says</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a huge procrastinator</li>
<li>that or I&rsquo;m just terribly lazy</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s a little bit of both</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve missed more classes than I should&rsquo;ve</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve kinda just given up on school work because I don&rsquo;t know</li>
<li>a little bit disillusioned with what I&rsquo;m studying, I suppose</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like it - it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;d probably be happier doing something else.</li>
<li>but being sensible, I can&rsquo;t go off to study literature or something - I need to get a job out of this</li>
<li>ideally, I&rsquo;d get out of the next five years with a specialist in computer science, a major in cognitive science, and a minor in mathematics</li>
<li>Angela still keeps telling me to drop out</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t just /drop out/</li>
<li>academically, I&rsquo;m doing somewhat well - my average thus far for my five courses is 85.4 // 4.0</li>
<li>but if we were graded on effort, I&rsquo;d have failed after the first week.</li>
<li>no one takes me seriously when I say that I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in my classes</li>
<li>I thought that university was supposed to give everyone a reality check?</li>
<li>I still haven&rsquo;t developed good work ethic</li>

<li>I just want to go home, okay? I&rsquo;m overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work I haven&rsquo;t done. I just want to drop out and go home.</li>
</ul>
