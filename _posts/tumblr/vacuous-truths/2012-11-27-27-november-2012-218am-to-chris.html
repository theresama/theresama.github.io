<p>I like it better when you&rsquo;re here - skin against skin, chest to chest. I like my legs tangled with your legs and my fingers tangled with your hair even though you don&rsquo;t like me playing with your bangs. I love listening to your heartbeat quicken as time slows down in perfect rhythmic harmony to the sound of your breathing. I love tracing your skin and clinging between the valleys of your fingers. I&rsquo;d rather just live in those moments where my nose touches your nose and I know you&rsquo;d never kiss and I&rsquo;d try not to because it feels like the moment would collapse. But I swear it&rsquo;s like your lips (I love them like a bad habit) slowly suck the sadness out from my soul - but the taste of respite leaves with you in the morning. And then the world is grey again and I&rsquo;m here alone sinking under these city lights and everything is bitter except the coffee. I suppose the optimistic part is that, even though we go weeks or months apart and we become different people with other people, something still fits. Or perhaps I&rsquo;m just too good at framing moments and hanging them in my mind like art that no one else feels. I&rsquo;ll try not to make a habit out of being so selfish, but the world just feels a little more right with your arms around me, the city a little less lonely with you beside me, &amp; my bed a little warmer with you in it.Â </p>
