<p>There are actually multiple North Korean travel companies that will take you on a tour of the world&rsquo;s most private country. </p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t fathom what life in North Korea would be like. Do the citizens know about the world beyond the country&rsquo;s borders? What kind of culture is created when there&rsquo;s no contact with the outside world? How poor is the quality of life? How do people live without the Internet? Living under a dictatorship seems like such a horror to me, but to those people, that&rsquo;s all they know. Is it possible for them to miss something that they&rsquo;ve never had? How does a fundamental difference in philosophy change the way we live?</p>
<p>To live in ignorance, to believe the lies that are told - that makes for a classic dystopia from the point of view of Western ideals. Yet, when you think about it, do any of us really know any more about what&rsquo;s going on around us? We tend to view everything as if it&rsquo;s in a little bubble - that the world does not stretch beyond the boundaries of our personal lives. If we choose not to educate ourselves, not to wonder and question beyond the information that we&rsquo;re given, aren&rsquo;t we also ignorant?</p>
<p>North Korea is going on my travel bucket-list.</p>
