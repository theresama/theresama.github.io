<ul><li>I enjoy painting because I am entirely ignorant of proper technique and all that shit. It&rsquo;s something I can do just for the sake of doing without worrying about formalities</li>
<li>Pulling memories and feelings from our minds and putting them into art - like songs and writings and visuals - it magnifies and distorts that which was perfect in the moment</li>
<li>Kisses never meant much to me but I really miss them today</li>
<li>I feel sad again for things I shouldn&rsquo;t feel sad about</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying my best to be honest, and honestly, there are just too many complications to which I haven&rsquo;t the spirit to deal with, and maybe I&rsquo;d prefer repression because it&rsquo;s simpler to deny myself than to address the attractions that I don&rsquo;t want to have. I feel kind of awful about it, but I suppose that&rsquo;s okay.</li>
