<p>how do i write words how do i words thoughts how to expressions how prose why can&rsquo;t i anymore words i don&rsquo;t have anything to say without sounding like a broken record because everything comes out as ~well i feel like shit~ and i can&rsquo;t even make that sound interesting anymore</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve become incapable of doing everything i once thought myself to be capable of. and i can&rsquo;t even figure out how to take out the dangling preposition in that sentence and i don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
