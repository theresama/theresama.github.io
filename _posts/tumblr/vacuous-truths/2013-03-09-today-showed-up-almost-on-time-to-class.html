<p>Today:</p>
<ul><li><span>Showed up almost on time to class #achievement</span></li>
<li><span>Got back that essay I pulled an all nighter on and it turns out that being 400 words below the lower bound translates into it being &ldquo;tightly argued&rdquo;. Not bad.</span></li>
<li><span>Took out pizza from this nice pizza place yum</span></li>
<li><span>Had a useless nap</span></li>
<li><span>I watched a play about gays in concentration camps during WWII.</span></li>
<li><span>Then watched a pie eating contest.</span></li>
<li><span>Somehow, the pie eating contest was more disturbing/disgusting (they weren&rsquo;t allowed to use their hands; it was who could eat the fastest using their faces).</span></li>
</ul>
