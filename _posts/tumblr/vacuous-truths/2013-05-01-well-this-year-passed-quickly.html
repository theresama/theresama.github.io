<p>First year is over. Wow. I&rsquo;m sitting in my chair in front of the laptop on the corner of my desk - a position in which I probably spent the past 80% of the past 8 months. It&rsquo;s the last night of the year; I have to be out by noon tomorrow. It already feels so different - the walls are bare, the shelves and drawers are empty, everything is gone. I&rsquo;ve been packing for the past couple days and my dad came by and picked everything up this afternoon. I guess I just wanted a few more hours in this home. Most everyone&rsquo;s gone. Walking down the hallway, everyone&rsquo;s taken down their name tags; you can tell they&rsquo;re gone. </p>
<p>This bareness feels almost like a deja-vu to the first time I walked in on move-in day. How was that eight months ago? Eight months ago, frosh leaders were helping me carry my fridge up to the third floor and I was unlocking the door for the first time. It felt like home from that first day. I remember arranging my belongings and looking up at the slanted ceiling and saying to myself, &ldquo;welcome home&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I remember walking into Whitney Hall for the first time and staring at a girl tying her shoes or something. Funny, she was moving out the same time as me today. It&rsquo;s like our whole relationship was a crazy coincidence or something. </p>
<p>Eight fucking months. Looking back is always so much easier than going through it. It&rsquo;s ridiculous that it&rsquo;s over. I spent too many of those months in a haze, wishing each day would disappear. Where&rsquo;d eight months go? I slept through it. It&rsquo;s kinda funny to wake up from depression and realize that everything&rsquo;s passed you by.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve learned very much, academically. For the first time in my life, I failed a course. That&rsquo;s right, I got an F - 40% in linear algebra. Go me. Dropping straight from the top to the bottom, ain&rsquo;t that something? I don&rsquo;t exactly remember when I had decided to just say <em>fuck it</em> to my academics. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve learned very much at all, actually. I kept saying to myself over and over again, <em>hey I&rsquo;m gonna get my shit together, I&rsquo;m gonna set my life straight </em>but the year&rsquo;s over and that never happened. Whoops.</p>
<p>Although, I gotta admit, I think I always knew that I would be an irresponsible wreck. C'mon, down inside, we all know exactly what kind of person we really are. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll miss this place. I really will. It&rsquo;s been good to me. I&rsquo;ve loved it here, despite everything. There&rsquo;ve been many great moments and memories, and also many little things I&rsquo;ve come to love. It&rsquo;s comfortable and familiar, it&rsquo;s <em>home</em>.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over; I&rsquo;m glad it was what it was. I can&rsquo;t really formulate thoughts or sentences at the moment or write anything that could do justice to the happenings of the year. It&rsquo;s pretty much been like a TV show and this is the cheesy little season finale that makes everything alright.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s alright.</p>
