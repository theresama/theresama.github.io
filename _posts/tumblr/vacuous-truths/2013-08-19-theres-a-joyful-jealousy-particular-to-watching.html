<p>There&rsquo;s a joyful jealousy particular to watching my kids enjoy the moments of the days. It&rsquo;s the crooked smile and silly eyes on their goofy little faces that tell of their little worlds of fun and delight. They&rsquo;re intoxicated with the indefatigable spirit of adventure and novelty as they run through the trails, dodging amongst the trees like wood nymphs and peering into critter holes as giants. It&rsquo;s a magical world.</p>
