<p>Where the artificial creations of men&rsquo;s developments are humbled by nature&rsquo;s own organic cities. How so very characteristically human it is to cower in awe before the timeless grandeur of nature&rsquo;s wonders. </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it the popular and common goal to search for the beautiful? We&rsquo;re obsessed with it - beauty and the way beautiful /nouns/ make us feel. We want to create it, to have it. We seek to replicate that which has already been Created.</p>

<p>Every contradicting facet of &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; - innocent, dangerous, wild, tranquil, symmetrical, special, enigmatic.. etc that inspire awe and wonderment is exactly what we crave to capture. </p>

<p>How many artists have passed through here and tried to capture what they saw? How many paintings, photographs, words, notes? &amp; still we try to describe the indescribable because these scenes leave impressions that are worth memorialising beyond their ephemeral moments. </p>

<p>Yet&hellip; I can&rsquo;t. I delight in arranging the music of words: metrics of sentences, rhythms of syllables, harmonies of style, the euphony of beautifully crafted prose - but I haven&rsquo;t the words to convey the precise colour of my sentiments, to preserve these impressions beyond a mere laundry list of adjectives.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m caught at <i>how do I words</i>? Is it lame if the answer is that some things need no description?</p>
