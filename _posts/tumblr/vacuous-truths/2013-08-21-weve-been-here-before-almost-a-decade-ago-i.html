<p>We’ve been here before - almost a decade ago. <br/>
I remember the glaciers larger, the water bluer. <br/>
It sounds like the classic, “things were better in my childhood”. <br/>
Has the world aged?<br/>
I thought of these natural wonders as immovable, unchangeable, static. <br/>
Isn’t it always like that - how can anything so grand ever be anything less?<br/>
But the world is alive; <br/>
the mountains grow <br/>
the glaciers retreat<br/>
the trees <br/>
breathe.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only my nine year old imagination that coloured the world brighter, bigger. Along with the hyperopic lens of hindsight and nostalgia for younger times (sentence fragment).</p>

<p>Ah, what good is it to ache for the innocence of children or the invincibility of adolescents - it’s a wasteful and easy wistfulness, unbecoming for an aged eighteen with all of adulthood left to live.</p>
