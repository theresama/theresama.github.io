Do you remember learning about limits and asymptotes in that advanced functions or calculus class you probably slept through? The asymptote is the straight line that a curve continually approaches but never meets. It's unreachable to infinity. I used to think that people were kind of like asymptotes - you can keep getting closer, but you'll never be there - if that makes any sense? But it's not quite like that, is it? Even the most reticent of us have, at some point, had the walls of our souls reached and breached. But it's easier to pretend to be an asymptote.
